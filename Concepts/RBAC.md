**Role-Based Access Control ([RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control))** is a security model where users are assigned roles, and each role has specific permissions to access resources or perform actions within a system. Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, access is granted based on the user's role.

### Key Concepts:

- **Roles:** Define what actions a user can perform (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- **Permissions:** Define what resources or actions the role can access (e.g., read, write, delete).
- **Users:** Assigned to one or more roles, and thus inherit the associated permissions.

RBAC helps manage access efficiently, ensuring users only have the necessary permissions to perform their job functions.
