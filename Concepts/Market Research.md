Search for platforms or tools that track the social media growth and engagement of artists across multiple platforms like Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, etc. Look for systems that allow users to see artist growth trends, track followers, listeners, subscribers, views, or similar metrics. Focus on competitors that showcase trending artists based on growth or audience engagement, not just raw numbers. Include tools that may collect data from platforms like Social-blade, API integrations, or scraping methods.

In the user-oriented space, we face little competition, but for industry professionals, robust analysis tools like Chartmetric already exist. However, artists donâ€™t typically use such tools to discover emerging talent. By creating an ecosystem, we can fill this gap and foster collaboration.

#### Competitors to Study

   Current tools like SocialBlade present artist analytics in a non-user-centric format For example page of [Tame Impala](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tameimpalamusic) is presented in a way which gives lot of analytics but isn't intuitive for the user.
