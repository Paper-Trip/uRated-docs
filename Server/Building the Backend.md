1. **Create a JSON file** to store artists as key-value pairs: `{username: Data[]}`. Each artist will have their social media links or usernames in the array.
2. **Fetch artist socials**: Check if the artist's socials (Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) are already in the database or need to be fetched from the web. Focus on famous artists as their data is more reliable.
3. **Collect social data**: For each platform (Spotify, YouTube, Instagram), gather relevant metrics like followers, listeners, subscribers, and views.
4. **Store in database**: Save the fetched data for each artist, including timestamps for trend tracking.
5. **Update periodically**: Regularly update the data for each artist and ensure it stays current for trend analysis.
